</p>

A simple **retro-style Ping Pong game** written in **C++**, inspired by the classic 1980s arcade game.  
This project is my first attempt at making a game in C++, focusing on **basic game loops**, **collision detection**, and **keyboard input handling**.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Classic **Ping Pong mechanics** 🏓  
✅ Two-player mode (local multiplayer)  
✅ Console-based ASCII graphics  
✅ Score tracking system  
✅ Lightweight — no external libraries required

- A **C++ compiler** (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`, or MSVC)
- A terminal/command prompt to run the program

### Installation & Run
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/My-first-game-in-C++.git

# Enter the project folder
cd My-first-game-in-C++

g++ main.cpp -o pingpong

# Run the game
./pingpong
````


## 🎮 Controls

🕹️ **Player 1:** `W` = Up | `S` = Down
🕹️ **Player 2:** `↑` = Up Arrow | `↓` = Down Arrow
❌ **Quit Game:** `Q`
