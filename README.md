# 🕹️ My First Game in C++ — Ping Pong

A simple **retro-style Ping Pong game** written in **C++**, inspired by the classic 1980s arcade game.  
This project is my first attempt at making a game in C++, focusing on **basic game loops**, **collision detection**, and **keyboard input handling**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Classic **Ping Pong mechanics** 🏓
- Player vs Player (two-player mode)
- Simple ASCII-based graphics in the console
- Score tracking system
- Runs directly in the terminal (no external libraries required)

## 🎮 Controls

* **Player 1:** `W` (up), `S` (down)
* **Player 2:** `↑` (up arrow), `↓` (down arrow)
* **Quit Game:** `Q`

## 📖 What I Learned

* Basics of **C++ game loops**
* Handling **user input** in real time
* **Collision detection** between ball and paddles
* Working with **ASCII graphics**

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add **single-player mode** with simple AI
* Improve graphics (e.g., SDL or SFML)
* Add sound effects
* Adjustable game speed / difficulty
